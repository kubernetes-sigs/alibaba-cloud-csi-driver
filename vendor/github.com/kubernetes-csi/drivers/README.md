# CSI Drivers

These drivers are provided purely for illustrative purposes, and should not be used for production workloads.

## Other sample drivers
Please read [Drivers](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/Drivers.html) for more information

## Adding new sample drivers
Please, DO NOT submit PRs to add new drivers here unless they are just examples. Real CSI drivers are to be housed on their own repo separate from this one. You are then welcomed to send a PR to https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/docs to add the [Driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/docs/wiki/Drivers) page.
